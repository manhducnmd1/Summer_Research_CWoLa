This code is used for summer research 2024 at National Taiwan University on weak supervision searches for beyond SM dijet signals, following the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06152
The preprocessing function code is adapted from github.com/heidelberg-hepml/ml-tutorials/blob/main/tutorial-5-jet-classification-with-cnns.ipynb. I am grateful to Prof. Cheng-Wei Chiang, Zong-En Chen, and Feng-Yang Hsieh for their contributions to the project.
Note the following pipeline for the codes: Extraction code for CWoLa --> Machine learning pipeline --> Postprocess and plot for CWoLA.
